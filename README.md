<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description

This app displays weather information for multiple cities. It's a fairly straightfoward, simple app, but there are a couple of things I'd like to note.
Not only can it handle and display multiple queries, but the app also utilizes the local storage so that information persists past the browser session.
Additionally, the app makes sure to validate user input, so that only valid/non-duplicate cities can be displayed. This helps save on the number network requests made.
Lastly, users may delete weather displays as they please.
